        Public WiFi networks help us stay connected on the go, while we shop, get coffee, or wait for the next flight. However, connecting to an unsecured WiFi network can expose your sensitive data like credit card numbers, passwords and even your personal photographs to hackers, identity thieves, and more.

        When you use Cypherpunk to connect to a public WiFi network, your online activity and data is encrypted, making it unreadable to anyone other than the desired recipient. We do not keep logs of any kind, helping you stay completely anonymous on the internet.
