    We provide Virtual Private Networking (VPN) services and other Internet privacy features. This Privacy Policy describes what information we keep and how we use it.
  </p>

  <h2 class="header blue">Disclosure</h2>

  <h4>Customer Service</h4>

  <p>
    We keep our live chat and e-mail conversations with you, unless you request this information to be deleted.
  </p>

  <br><br>

  <h3 class="subheader">2. When you sign up for our service:</h3>

  <p>
    In order to provide our users with quality customer service, we keep a few pieces of information:
  </p>

  <p>
    - E-mail address. We ask for your e-mail address as part of your account registration. This ensures that we can communicate with you when we have issues regarding your account and send you notifications regarding updates to our services.
  </p>

  <p>
    - Payment data. Although we encourage our users to purchase our service with Bitcoin for the maximum level of privacy, we also offer alternative payment methods for your convenience. We do not store your name, any credit card numbers, or address information. We only keep the relevant transaction data needed for refund requests and to provide you with customer service.
  </p>

  <br><br>

  <h3 class="subheader">3. While you use our software:</h3>

  <p>
    When using our Cypherpunk Privacy service, your Internet traffic will be encrypted according to your selected cryptographic profile and anonymized by mixing it with many other users’ traffic. Using strong encryption to connect to our privacy service will make your online activities opaque to governments, ISPs, and third party adversaries.
  </p>

  <p>
    Furthermore, we have a strict no-logging policy when it comes to user activity online: being based in Iceland, a country which offers the most Internet privacy and freedom in the world, we are not required to perform any data storage or reporting of any kind, and we are empowered to deny any third-party requests.
  </p>

  <br><br>

  <h3 class="subheader">4. While you are connected to our network:</h3>

  <p>
    Our backend infrastructure constantly load balances our users across a network of servers to continuously optimize the speed and performance of our service. This ensures that we can provide you with a high level of availability, with consistently fast speeds throughout our entire privacy protection network. Our backend infrastructure does not observe any individual user traffic, and is only for these network optimization purposes.
  </p>

  <p>
    If, and only if a user opts-in, our software may send diagnostic and analytics data for the purpose of reporting connection errors, possible bugs in our application, and optimizing the user experience. The information does not contain personally identifying information.
  </p>

  <br><br>

  <p class="lead">
    <strong>
      In summary, we only know enough to contact you for customer service and to enhance your experience using our service. None of your Internet traffic or personal data is logged or collected.
    </strong>
  </p>

  <br><br>

  <h2 class="header blue">Policy Changes</h2>

  <p>
    You understand that our present Privacy Policy is subject to changes made by us, at any time, in our sole discretion. You understand that it is your obligation to periodically review our Privacy Policy in order to account for any changes made.
  </p>
